# Datasets {#data}

Throughout the book, all models and techniques are applied to real datasets that are freely available online.
We will use different datasets for different tasks:
Classification, regression and text classification.

## Bike Rentals (Regression) {#bike-data}
This dataset contains daily counts of rented bicycles from the bicycle rental company [Capital-Bikeshare](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/) in Washington D.C., along with weather and seasonal information.
The data was kindly made openly available by Capital-Bikeshare.
Fanaee-T and Gama (2013)[^Fanaee] added weather data and season information.
The goal is to predict how many bikes will be rented depending on the weather and the day.
The data can be downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).


New features were added to the dataset and not all original features were used for the examples in this book.
Here is the list of features that were used:

- Count of bicycles including both casual and registered users.
The count is used as the target in the regression task.
- The season, either spring, summer, fall or winter.
- Indicator whether the day was a holiday or not.
- The year, either 2011 or 2012.
- Number of days since the 01.01.2011 (the first day in the dataset).
This feature was introduced to take account of the trend over time.
- Indicator whether the day was a working day or weekend.
- The weather situation on that day. One of:
    - clear, few clouds, partly cloudy, cloudy
    - mist + clouds, mist + broken clouds, mist + few clouds, mist
    - light snow, light rain + thunderstorm + scattered clouds, light rain + scattered clouds
    - heavy rain + ice pallets + thunderstorm + mist, snow + mist
- Temperature in degrees Celsius.
- Relative humidity in percent (0 to 100).
- Wind speed in km per hour.


For the examples in this book, the data has been slightly processed.
You can find the processing R-script in the book's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/christophM/interpretable-ml-book/blob/master/R/get-bike-sharing-dataset.R) together with the [final RData file](https://github.com/christophM/interpretable-ml-book/blob/master/data/bike.RData).

## YouTube Spam Comments (Text Classification) {#spam-data}

As an example for text classification we work with 1956 comments from 5 different YouTube videos.
Thankfully, the authors who used this dataset in an article on spam classification made the data  [freely available](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YouTube+Spam+Collection) (Alberto, Lochter, and Almeida (2015)[^Alberto]).

The comments were collected via the YouTube API from five of the ten most viewed videos on YouTube in the first half of 2015. 
All 5 are music videos.
One of them is "Gangnam Style" by Korean artist Psy. 
The other artists were Katy Perry, LMFAO, Eminem, and Shakira.


Checkout some of the comments. 
The comments were manually labeled as spam or legitimate.
Spam was coded with a "1" and legitimate comments with a "0".

```{r show-dating-data-TubeSpam}
library(kableExtra)
data(ycomments)
tab = kableExtra::kbl(ycomments[1:10, c('CONTENT', 'CLASS')], booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Sample of comments from the YouTube Spam dataset")
if (is.pdf) tab = tab %>% column_spec(1, width = "10cm")
tab
```

You can also go to YouTube and take a look at the comment section.
But please do not get caught in YouTube hell and end up watching videos of monkeys stealing and drinking cocktails from tourists on the beach.
The Google Spam detector has also probably changed a lot since 2015.

[Watch the view-record breaking video "Gangnam Style" here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0&feature=player_embedded).

If you want to play around with the data, you can find the [RData file](https://github.com/christophM/interpretable-ml-book/blob/master/data/ycomments.RData) along with the [R-script](https://github.com/christophM/interpretable-ml-book/blob/master/R/get-SpamTube-dataset.R) with some convenience functions in the book's GitHub repository.

## Palmer Penguins (Classification) {#penguins}

For classification, we will use the Palmer penguin data.
This cute dataset contains measurements from hundreds of penguins from the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica.
The dataset was collected and published by Gorman et al. (2014) [^gorman2014] and the Palmer Station in Antarctica, which is part of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.
The dataset is loaded using the palmerpenguins R package [^palmerpenguins-r-package].

```{r palmer-penguins-species, fig.cap = "The 3 penguin species in the data: Chinstrap, Gentoo, Adelie. Artwork by @allison_horst.", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lter_penguins.png")
```


Each row represents a penguin and contains the following information:

- The species of penguin (Chinstrap/Gentoo/Adelie) that we will use as the output for classification for the examples in this book.
- The weight of the penguin, measured in grams.
- The length of the bill (the beak) measured in millimeters (see also the following Figure).
- The depth of the bill, measured in millimeters.
- Th sex of the penguin (male/female).
- The island the penguin came from (Biscoe/Dream/Torgersen). However, we will not use this as a feature because it is too predictive of the species.

```{r palmer-penguins-bill, fig.cap = "Bill measurements. Artwork by @allison_horst.", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/culmen_depth.png")
```


11 penguins had missing data.
Since the purpose of this data is to demonstrate interpretable machine learning methods and not an in-depth study of penguins, I simply dropped the missing values.
